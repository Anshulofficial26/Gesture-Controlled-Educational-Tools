Develop an innovative educational technology solution that leverages hand gesture control and Python libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe) to enhance the interactive learning experience. The goal is to create a platform where users can intuitively navigate presentations, annotate content, and interact with educational modules through natural hand gestures. Additionally, the project aims to integrate advanced features such as AI-powered virtual input methods, virtual science labs, interactive solar system exploration, and 3D interactive anatomy models to revolutionize the way students and educators engage with educational content.
